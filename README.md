# Pharmaci

## Purpose: 
The purpose of this project was to integrate what I learned with React and MySQL. 
Learning about backend technologies, I thought of it while joking about how the names of medications are often odd and rarely euphonious.
With the click of a button, random names of fictional medications are generated from the backend as a result of concatenation.

## Built with: 
React, React-Bootstrap, MySQL, Express, Node, and Axios

## Demo:
